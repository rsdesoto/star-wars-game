taking a stab at the harder homework

### Credit

All images poached from wookieepedia. I know the Bastila and Exile photos are lo-fi; the games came out in 2003 and 2004, respectively, and most of the art of them (especially Meetra Surik, or whatever her "canon" name is) are either not great quality or they don't have cool laser swords.

### "Hey Ry, you've gone with all women, except for Darth Revan, what's with that?"

1. I think it's a mistake, honestly, to give a canonical gender/appearance/etc to any player character for any player characters where you can pick their traits. Fans get attached to "their" Revan (or Exile, or Cmdr Shepard, or Courier Six, or etc) and then have to deal with some other, incorrect version in supplemental canon. (Supplemental canon isn't real anyway, and the EU, rest its ridiculous soul, is no longer with us)
1. Darth Revan is a woman, fight me
