A KOTOR-themed RPG. Choose a fighter and battle your way through opponents until you defeat them all...... or yourself fall to darkness.

### Strategy

Every time a fighter attacks, her attack power will increase. Grinding attack strength against enemies who can't kill you is the easiest way to build up your strength and win the game.

#### "Hey Ry, you've gone with all women, except for Darth Revan, what's with that?"

1. I think it's a mistake, honestly, to give a canonical gender/appearance/etc to any player character for any player characters where you can pick their traits. Fans get attached to "their" Revan (or Exile, or Cmdr Shepard, or Courier Six, or etc) and then have to deal with some other, incorrect version in supplemental canon.
1. Also, Darth Revan is a woman, fight me
