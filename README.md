taking a stab at the harder homework

### Instructions

Choose a fighter. Battle your way through opponents until you defeat them all...... or yourself fall to darkness.

The fighter's attacks increase with every attack as she trains. Apparently counter-attacks aren't a thing jedis spend much time on, so that number will be static.

### Credit

All static images poached from each respective character's bio on wookieepedia, edited by me to make them squares. Gifs poached from giphy and tenor.

#### "Hey Ry, you've gone with all women, except for Darth Revan, what's with that?"

1. I think it's a mistake, honestly, to give a canonical gender/appearance/etc to any player character for any player characters where you can pick their traits. Fans get attached to "their" Revan (or Exile, or Cmdr Shepard, or Courier Six, or etc) and then have to deal with some other, incorrect version in supplemental canon. (Supplemental canon isn't real anyway, and the EU, rest its ridiculous soul, is no longer with us)
1. Darth Revan is a woman, fight me
